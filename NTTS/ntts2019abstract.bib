 abstract = {Shapiro and Wilk's (1965) W statistic arguably provides the best omnibus test of normality, but is currently limited to sample sizes between 3 and 50. W is extended up to n = 2000 and an approximate normalizing transformation suitable for computer implementation is given. A novel application of W in transforming data to normality is suggested, using the three-parameter lognormal as an example.},

 abstract = {X-12-ARIMA is the Census Bureau's new seasonal-adjustment program. It provides four types of enhancements to X-11-ARIMA--(1) alternative seasonal, trading-day, and holiday effect adjustment capabilities that include adjustments for effects estimated with user-defined regressors; additional seasonal and trend filter options; and an alternative seasonal-trend-irregular decomposition; (2) new diagnostics of the quality and stability of the adjustments achieved under the options selected; (3) extensive time series modeling and model-selection capabilities for linear regression models with ARIMA errors, with optional robust estimation of coefficients; (4) a new user interface with features to facilitate batch processing large numbers of series.},

type = {Working Papers},
abstract = {In this article, a unified approach to automatic modeling for univariate series is presented. First, ARIMA models and the classical methods for fitting these models to a given time series are reviewed. Second, some objective methods for model identification are considered and some algorithmical procedures for automatic model identification are described. Third, outliers are incorporated into the model and an algorithm, for automatic model identification in the presence of outliers is proposed.},
